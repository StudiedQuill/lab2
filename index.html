	<h1>All About John</h1>
	<p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
	<p>A few things about myself are that I am a first year undergrad student majoring in Applied Cybersecurity and Informational Technology.</p>
	<p>Something else that you should know is that I am vegetarian and have been since 2018.</p>
	<p>I really enjoy staying active, healthy and fit so you will find me a lot of the time running or exercising in some way.</p>
	<p> I currently work in Olive Garden back in my hometown of Aurora, Illinois as a busser, Togo Specialist, and Server.</p>
